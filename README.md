# DSU Packager
Unity Editor Script created to make the process of sharing unity assets easier.

Packages are a built-in feature of Unity. They allow you to share assets between projects while still keeping track of boring stuff such as versions, dependencies and licenses.

This plugin adds a custom editor window that makes it easier to create a new package. The plugin also configures the new package folder as a local git repository with all the recommended settings for Unity projects (.gitignore, .gitattributes, git LFS, etc.). You can then easily upload the repository to github and track changes there. Other people can then use your assets by just adding the GitHub URL inside their own Unity projects.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the following software installed:
* Git
* Git LFS
* Git Flow
2. Open Unity and open the Package Manager (located under `Window -> Package Manager`)
3. Press the `+` icon and select `Add Package From git URL...`
4. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/UniversityOfSkovde/DSU-Packager.git` and press `Add`
5. You can now find the plugin in the top menu under `DSU -> Create New Package`

## Update To The Latest Version
When you add this plugin (or a package created by this plugin) to a Unity project, the editor will pull the latest version published to GitHub. It will then lock onto that version even if new changes are pushed to the repository. To release the lock and download the latest changes, go to the `Packages/manifest.json`-file and remove the entire `lock`-section.

```json
  ...
  "lock": {
    "se.his.dsu-packager": {
      "revision": "HEAD",
      "hash": "9a808f660d49112200e0bf65a0e57a1d8b48ff21"      
    }
  }
```

## Publishing a Unity Package
Do you have some assets you want to share with the world using git?

1. In the top menu, select `DSU -> Create New Package`
2. Fill in the name, author and license you want for the new package
3. Press `Generate Package Folder!` and wait a few seconds

The new package should now shop up in the `Project` as a subdirectory of `Packages`
1. Move all the assets you want to share to the `Runtime`-directory of your new package
2. Use the commands `git add -A` and `git commit -m "Uploading files"` to version control the files you just moved

To share the new package, open a browser and go to github.com (create a new account of necessary).
1. On GitHub.com, press `New` to create a new repository
2. **Do not** select `Initialize this repository with a README` or select a license/.gitignore
3. Follow the instructions shown under the header `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` from root folder of the generated package.
4. Others can now add your package to their projects using the `Add Package From git URL...` option described above.
