# DSU Packager
Unity Editor Script created to make the process of sharing unity assets easier.

Packages are a built-in feature of Unity. This plugin adds a custom editor window that makes it easier to create a new package. The plugin also configures the new package folder as a local git repository with all the recommended settings for Unity projects (.gitignore, .gitattributes, git LFS, etc.).

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have the following software installed:
* Git
* Git LFS
* Git Flow
2. Open Unity and open the Package Manager (located under `Window -> Package Manager`)
3. Press the `+` icon and select `Add Package From git URL...`
4. Enter the URL: `https://github.com/UniversityOfSkovde/DSU-Packager.git` and press `Add`
5. You can now find the plugin in the top menu under `DSU -> Create New Package`

## Publishing a Unity Package
Do you have some assets you want to share with the world using git?

1. In the top menu, select `DSU -> Create New Package`
2. Fill in the name, author and license you want for the new package
3. Press `Generate Package Folder!` and wait a few seconds

The new package should now shop up in the `Project` as a subdirectory of `Packages`
1. Move all the assets you want to share to the `Runtime`-directory of your new package
2. Use the commands `git add -A` and `git commit -m "Uploading files"` to version control the files you just moved

To share the new package, open a browser and go to github.com (create a new account of necessary).
1. On GitHub.com, press `New` to create a new repository
2. **Do not** select `Initialize this repository with a README` or select a license/.gitignore
3. Follow the instructions shown under the header `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` from root folder of the generated package.
4. Others can now add your package to their projects using the `Add Package From git URL...` option described above.
